Welcome to the DeepTrading project, where we explore and analyze stock data collected from AlphaVantage. This README provides an overview of the data analysis and visualizations conducted in the project.

## Data Analysis

In this project, we've conducted a comprehensive analysis of the stock data. Below, you will find key findings and visualizations from our analysis:

### 1. Plot of Opening Prices of All Equities

**Context:** This visualization shows the opening prices of all the equities in our dataset. It provides an initial overview of the stock price trends for the companies we've studied, helping you understand the overall market conditions.

### 2. Correlation Matrix of the Above Companies

**Context:** The correlation matrix offers insights into how different equities are related to each other. A high positive correlation suggests that two stocks move in the same direction, while a negative correlation implies they move in opposite directions. This can help you identify pairs of stocks that might influence each other.

### 3. Linkage Matrix of the Equities

**Context:** The linkage matrix is often used in hierarchical clustering to identify groups of related equities. It helps us understand how stocks can be grouped based on their price behaviors. This information can be valuable for diversifying your investment portfolio.

### 4. Correlation Graph of the Equities

**Context:** This graph visually represents the correlations between different equities, providing a network of relationships. It's a useful way to identify which equities have stronger connections and can influence each other. This can guide your trading strategy and risk management.

### 5. Equity B with Other Indicators Plotted

**Context:** This visualization focuses on "Equity B" and displays additional indicators that might affect its price movement. Understanding these indicators can help in making more informed investment decisions. This is especially important for those interested in the performance of specific stocks.

### 6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the Equities with Added Indicators

**Context:** Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique. Here, we've applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most critical information. The visualization shows the components and the percentage of explained variance for each component. This is helpful for simplifying complex datasets and focusing on the most impactful factors.

### 7. Components and Their Percentage Explained Variance

**Context:** This visualization provides a clear picture of how much variance in the data is explained by each principal component. It helps us understand which components capture the most important information in the dataset. This is crucial for prioritizing your analysis and making well-informed decisions.
